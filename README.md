# Calculate the average
A very simple C++ program that calculates your GPA for your convenience.
It always took me a long time to figure out whether or not I would be conditioned (GPA < 12) this semester :D,
so I decided to write this simple program.

## In the future
Become a graphic application.

## Compatibility
You should be able to run this program anywhere. For the compiling process, both of [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) should work.
### Tested Environments
OS:  [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/uk-ua/) Windows 10 Pro, Compiler: [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) C++ Compiler (8.1.0)
